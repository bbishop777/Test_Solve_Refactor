# Test_Solve_Refactor
Test...Solve...Refactor...Commit

We are going to be doing a quickfire challenge to solve the following objectives in a short amount of time in the following order:

Create a new project
Setup mocha/chai to be our testing framework
Write a few tests for the algorithm we are going to solve
Implement our algorithm
Make the tests pass
Refactor our code and ensure that tests still pass
Create new repo on your GitHub profile and push up our solution
The Challenge

Write an algorithm that with a given single input of type Number, returns the sum of the square root of every number from 1 to the number that was passed in.
